# Stream Scheduler

This is the first mini product i would like to create.



### User Stories Flow

- As a Common Layman, I would like to  create schedules for my Live Events. 

- I usually use some Tools like OBS, StreamLabs to Schedule

- Prepare a List of Images, Title and Description and Schedule Them

- As soon as you start the OBS Stream, The Programme will Listen for the Event and Start the Session Automatically.

- What a Normal User expects ?

  - All i wanted a Simple Button to Trigger the Event
  - How to Pass the Trigger ?
  - Check for a Value in the Textbox (No realtime)

  I am Still Confused how to create this as a Product. Will come back to this Later for a AddOn based Feature.

- Until then, Try using a Non-AddOn Scripts
