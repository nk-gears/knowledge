# Custom Connectors  

Authoring and Editing the Custom Connectors using the IDE might be cumbersome if there are large no of actions to be created. Currently the IDE seems to be unresponsive when dealing with more than 50+ actions in a custom connector as of Jun 2020. 



To make things easier, Microsoft community has a cli based solution called "paconn" to author and deploy these connectors. It's basically a tool for quickly create, validate and deploy for Power Automate Custom Connectors without going to the IDE. Chekout here.
