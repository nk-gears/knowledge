# Converse with GOD

>GOD: Sure. Activity gets you busy. But productivity gets you results .Activity consumes time. Productivity frees it. 

>Me: I understand. But I still can't figure out. By the way, I was notexpecting YOU to buzz me on instant messaging chat. 
>GOD: Well, I wanted to resolve your fight for time , by giving you someclarity. In this net era, I wanted to reach you through the medium you arecomfortable with. 

>Me: Tell me, why has life become complicated now? 
>GOD: Stop analyzing life. Just live it. Analysis is what makes itcomplicated. 

>Me: Why are we then constantly unhappy? 
>GOD: Your today is the tomorrow that you worried about yesterday. You are worrying because you are Analyzing. Worrying has become your habit. That’s why you are not happy. 

>Me: But how can we not worry when there is so much uncertainty? 
>GOD: Uncertainty is inevitable, but worrying is optional. 

>Me: But then, there's so much pain due to uncertainty... 
>GOD: Pain is inevitable, but suffering is optional. 

>Me: If suffering is optional, why do good people always suffer? 
>GOD: Diamond cannot be polished without friction. Gold cannot be purified without fire. Good people go through trials, but don't suffer. With that experience their life becomes better, not bitter. 

>Me: You mean to say such experience is useful? 
>GOD: Yes. In every term, Experience is a hard teacher. She gives the testfirst and the lessons afterwards. 

>Me: But still, why should we go through such tests? Why can't we be freefrom problems? 
>GOD: Problems are P urposeful R oadblocks O ffering B eneficial L essons to E nhance M ental S trength. Inner strength comes from struggle and endurance, not when you are free from problems. 

>Me: Frankly in the midst of so many problems, we don't know where we are heading... 
>GOD: If you look outside you will not know where you are heading. Lookinside. Looking outside, you dream. Looking inside, you awaken. Eyes provide sight. Heart provides insight. 

>Me: Sometimes not succeeding fast seems to hurt more than moving in the right direction. What should I do? 
>GOD: Success is a measure as decided by others. Satisfaction is a measure as decided by you. Knowing the road ahead is more satisfying than knowing you rode ahead. You work with the compass. Let others work with the clock. 

>Me: In tough times, how do you stay motivated? 
>GOD: Always look at how far you have come rather than how far you have to go. Always count your blessing, not what you are missing. 

>Me: What surprises you about people? 
>GOD: When they suffer they ask, "why me?" When they prosper, they never ask “Why me?" Everyone wishes to have truth on their side, but few want to be on the side of the truth. 

>Me: Sometimes I ask, who I am, why am I here. I can't get the answer. 
>GOD: Seek not to find who you are, but to determine who you want to be. Stop looking for a purpose as to why you are here. Create it. Life is not a process of discovery, but a process of creation. 

>Me: How can I get the best out of life? 
>GOD: Face your past without regret. Handle your present with confidence.Prepare for the future without fear. 

>Me: One last question. Sometimes I feel my prayers are not answered. 
>GOD: There are no unanswered prayers. At times the answer is NO. 

>Me: Thank you for this wonderful chat. I am so happy to start the New Day with a new sense of inspiration. 
>GOD: Well. Keep the faith and drop the fear. Don't believe your doubts and doubt your beliefs. Life is a mystery to solve, not a problem to resolve. Trust me. Life is wonderful if you know how to live.
