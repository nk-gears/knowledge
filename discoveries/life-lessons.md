#### Be Calm

- The most Important thing in Life is "Be Calm"
- Whatever may happen. Everything happens for a Purpose. 
- We may end up with something unexpected. But still there is some goodness in that.
- You have saved all your great memories in a HDD and you missed to take a backup and one day the HDD may go dead. Still there is no need to get disappointed or annoyed. Be Calm.
- Nothing we can lose. 
- Remember the saying. There is no UnBearable Pain in the world.
