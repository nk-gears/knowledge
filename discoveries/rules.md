# Rules for the Self

#### Keep everything Organized

- Your Brain may be a Unlimited Storage Box. But you need to Organize both Externally and Internally

- Without Organisation, We Human beings end up with a State of Confusion and Chaos. 

- This is applicable Both for Tangible and Non-Tangible Things.
