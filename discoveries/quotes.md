  **Charlie Chaplin**
  "if someone wants to know about his Life, Then watch my Silent Movie which explains my Life. He also added that a silent movie can convey more message to the audience than a movie with voice. Infact in 1920, even though the Movie with Audio is available he still used the Silent Movie Approach for his Films."

  **Bruce Lee**
